# Primitives

#### Definition. (Primitives)

Let $E$ be a normed vector space, and $f: A \to E$ be a map defined on a perfect set $A$ in $\R$. We will say $F: A \to E$ is a *primitive* of $f$ if it is differentiable and $F' = f$. In this case, we will also say $f$ *admits primitives*. The set of all such maps will be denoted by $D^{-1}(A, E)$, although this notation is not standard.

#### Theorem. (Linear combinations admit primitives)
Let $f, g: I \to \R$ be two maps defined on the interval $I$ that admit primitivies on $I$. Then, any linear combination $af + bg$ also admits primitives on $I$.

#### Theorem. (Products sometimes admit primitives, continuous derivative)
Let $f, g: I \to \R$ be two maps defined on the interval $I$ such that $f$ admits primitives on $I$, and $g$ is differentiable with continuous derivative. Then, their product $fg$ admits primitives.

#### Theorem. (Products sometimes admit primitives, bounded derivative)
Let $f, g: I \to \R$ be two maps defined on the interval $I$ such that $f$ admits primitives on $I$, and $g$ is differentiable with bounded derivative. Then, their product $fg$ admits primitives.

#### Theorem. (W. Wilkosz)
Let $f, g: I \to \R$ be two maps defined on the interval $I$ such that $f$ admits primitives on $I$ and is bounded from above or below, and $g$ is continuous. Then, their product $fg$ admits primitives.
