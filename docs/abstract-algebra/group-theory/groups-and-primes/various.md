## Minimal Normal Subgroup

<div class="compact" markdown>
#### Theorem. 
Let $G$ be a finite group, and $N \not= 1$ a minimal normal subgroup. Then, there is a simple group $S$ and a positive integer $n$ so that $N \cong S^n$. 

*Proof.* Naturally, $N$ has a minimal normal subgroup $M \not= 1$ as well. Moreover, for any $g \in G$, the conjugate $gMg^{-1}$ is normal and minimal in $N$. Thus, any two distinct conjugates must intersect trivially, since their intersection is normal. Let $K = \prod_{g \in G}{gMg^{-1}}$
