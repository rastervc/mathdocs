# Direct Products

<div class="compact" markdown>
***Theorem.***
Let $G$ and $H$ be two groups and $K \le G \times H$ a subgroup of their direct product. Then, there exist $G_2 \trianglelefteq G_1 \le G$ and $H_2 \trianglelefteq H_1 \le H$, as well as an isomorphism $\phi: G_1/G_2 \to H_1/H_2$ such that $K$ can be described as
<div>$$ K = \{(g, h) \in G_1 \times H_1 \mid \phi(gG_2) = hH_2 \}$$</div>
