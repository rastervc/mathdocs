# More on $p$-Groups

<div class="compact" markdown>
***Theorem.*** Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. Then, the center of $G$ is non-trivial.

*Proof.* Let $G$ act on itself by conjugation. The set of values fixed by all elements of $G$ is $Z(G)$, and since $G$ is a $p$-group, we get the congruence
<div>$$ |Z(G)| \equiv |G| \equiv 0 \pmod p $$</div>
by the $p$-group action lemma. Thus, $Z(G)$ cannot be empty.

## Nilpotent groups and $p$-groups

***Theorem.*** All $p$-groups are nilpotent.

***Theorem.*** A finite group is nilpotent iff it is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups.
