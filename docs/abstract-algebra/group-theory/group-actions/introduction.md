# Introduction

***Definition.*** Let $G$ be a group and $\Lambda$ a non-empty set. We define a *group action* of $G$ on $\Lambda$ to be a group homomorphism $\mu: G \to \Sym(\Lambda)$. It is common to use the notations 
<div>$$x\lambda \quad\quad x \cdot \lambda \quad\quad ^x\lambda$$</div> to mean $\mu(x)(\lambda)$, the *action* of $x$ on $\lambda$. If $\mu$ is injective, we call it a *faithful* action. Sometimes, we will write $G \acts \Lambda$ with the meaning that $G$ acts on $\Lambda$. This symbol will also be used as a placeholder for the map $\mu$. In particular, we define the *kernel of the group action* to be $\ker(G \acts \Lambda) = \ker \mu$

## G-Set morphisms

***Definition.*** Let $G$ be a group and suppose $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda'$ are two $G$-sets. We define a *$G$-set morphism* between them to be a map $f: \Lambda \to \Lambda'$ satisfying $f(x\lambda) = xf(\lambda)$ for every $x \in G$ and $\lambda \in \Lambda$.
