## Homomorphisms

***Definition.*** (Homomorphism) Let $R$ and $S$ be two rings. We call $f: R \to S$ a *ring homomorphism* if and only if $f(1_R) = f(1_S)$ and for any $x, y \in R$ the following relations hold.
<div class="wide-screen"> 
$$f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) \quad\quad f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$$
</div>
<div class="thin-screen">
$$f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$$
$$f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$$
</div>
These are called additivity and multiplicativity. We may likewise define homomorphisms for rngs, semirings and non-associative rngs.
