# Algebras

## The pretty case

***Definition.*** Let $R$ be a commutative unital ring. Then we call an $R$-algebra a unital ring $A$ together with a homomorphism $f: R \to Z(A)$ defining an action of $R$ on $A$,
<div> $$ r \cdot x = f(r)x $$ </div>
which gives it the structure of an $R$-module. If $A$ is commutative, then we call it a commutative algebra. 

## The general case
***Definition.*** Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Then we call an $R$-algebra a non-associative ring $A$ that is also a left $R$-module, with the property that ring multiplication is bilinear with respect to module structure. We also introduce the notions of associative, unital and commutative algebras with their natural meanings.

According to this more general definition, what we initially called an algebra is now a unital associative algebra.
